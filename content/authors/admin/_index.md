I am Zhengjie Miao (苗正杰), currently a PhD student in the [Department of Computer Science, Duke University](http://www.cs.duke.edu/). I am working with [Prof. Sudeepa Roy](https://users.cs.duke.edu/~sudeepa/) and [Prof. Jun Yang](https://users.cs.duke.edu/~junyang/) on [databases](https://sites.duke.edu/duke_dbgroup/). Here is my [curriculum vitae](./pdf/cv.pdf).

Before joining Duke, I received M.S. in Computer Science from [Columbia University](http://www.cs.columbia.edu/), where I've worked on interactive data analysis system under the advisory of [Prof. Eugene Wu](http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~ewu). I got my B.S. in Computer Science from [Peking University](http://eecs.pku.edu.cn/), under the advisory of [Prof. Xiaoru Yuan](http://vis.pku.edu.cn/yuanxiaoru/).
