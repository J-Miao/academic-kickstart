abstract = "We proposed a collaborative platform to analyze streaming microblog messages in real-time on the emergence of security events, for VAST 2014 Mini Challenge 3. Our team members monitored and analyzed the streaming data simultaneously on it, where we could flexibly distribute workloads by filtering the data streams as we liked, and share notable information such as suspects and locations. With the assistance of a keyword analyzer, we were able to stay vigilant for potential emergencies in the course of streamingand conduct postmortem analysis. We will describe the collaborativemechanisms, as well as the design principles and considerationsin detail."
